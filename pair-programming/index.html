						<small><i>source: The Costs and Benefits of Pair Programming</i> - Alistair Cockburn, Laurie Williams.</small>
						<aside class="notes">What we can learn from Laurie William's experiment is that in the first experiment the students needed extra time to get used to each other - the time cost was greater. However in the next iterations the extra time cost settled at about 15% extra value. Without any further investigation we can say that yes, pair programming costs time. But Laurie decided to investigate further and learned that there is more than 15 percents defects reduction rate in all of the 3 experiments. Investment.</aside>
