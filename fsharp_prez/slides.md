# Shiki Magic Move

Powered by [shiki-magic-move](https://shiki-magic-move.netlify.app/), Slidev supports animations across multiple code snippets.

Add multiple code blocks and wrap them with <code>````md magic-move</code> (four backticks) to enable the magic move. For example:

````md magic-move {lines: true}
```ts {2}
// step 1
const author = reactive({
  name: "John Doe",
  books: [
    "Vue 2 - Advanced Guide",
    "Vue 3 - Basic Guide",
    "Vue 4 - The Mystery",
  ],
});
```

```ts {3-4}
// step 1
const author = reactive({
  name: "John Doe",
  books: [
    "Vue 2 - Advanced Guide",
    "Vue 3 - Basic Guide",
    "Vue 4 - The Mystery",
  ],
});
```

```ts
// step 1
const author = reactive({
  name: "John Doe",
  books: [
    "Vue 2 - Advanced Guide",
    "Vue 3 - Basic Guide",
    "Vue 4 - The Mystery",
  ],
});
```
